# ShepherdcastCardCloner
Our church has a weekly podcast (The Shepherdcast) which we distribute to our shut-ins on MP3 players.  Every week, we swap out the SD cards so our shut-ins get the newest recordings while still keeping the old ones.  To automate the process a little bit, we created this small computer program to batch write SD cards
